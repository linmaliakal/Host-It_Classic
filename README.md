### 2. Overall Description
<dl>
<dt> Product Description </dt>
<dd> The idea, as described, was originated from personal experiences with planning and preparing for hosted events. With this product, we hope to take on the functionality of creating events on Facebook and make a better mobile way to do so and keep track of components of such events. With the transition from Facebook to other social media sites, we hope this application works as a more receptive replacement for the events function of Facebook.  <dd> <br>
<dt> Product Functions </dt>
<dd> The main functionality of this product is in helping plan and prepare for self-hosted events. As of now, we are continuously working to make user flow of the application seamless for the target audience of young adults. The detailed functionality is shown in the UML diagram that can be found in Appendix B. <dd> <br>
<dt> User Classes and Characteristics </dt>
<dd> Paragraph <dd>
<dt> Operating Environment </dt>
<dd> This application as of now is being developed with a focus on iOS devices, however in the future we hope to have a version developed for Android devices as well. It will be running through the Cordova framework for mobile applications, using a website baseline in terms of languages being used (HTML5/CSS3, JS). Any iPhone would ideally be able to display this application, however we are using an iPhone XS as the simulator in development.
 <dd> <br>
<dt> Design and Implementation Constraints </dt>
<dd> This application will need to be run in a mobile setting using HTML5/CSS3 and JS. The primary language for the user would be English. Down the line, language translators could be used if the user speaks another language. Firebase will be used for data storage and login, so the login page of our application would take the user to the Google sign in page if they choose that option of logging in. Most of the design conventions the application will implement are going to be intuitive for anyone who has used mobile applications before. Navigation and interactions would carry over from other application designs for a quicker and easier user experience. Since this application as of now will be using the Cordova framework, anyone looking at this code or wanting to run it themselves will need to understand how Cordova works and have all the necessary installations for an iOS device on their computer. For example, if said developer wants to run the application on an Android emulator, they would need to install various cordova requirements, such as Android Studio, to see it run.
 <dd> <br>
<dt> User Documentation </dt>
<dd> We will have a “How to Run” in our README markdown to help explain to developers looking at our code how to run it. For the users themselves, we would hope to have a quick sort of guide to how the application works, but most of the interactions would be intuitive, given the user has used mobile apps before. The user should need intense tutorials to use this application, as it is meant to make planning events an easier process for young adults. Down the road, with the application’s download, the user would be provided screenshots of the screens and the button functionalities to explain what the non-intuitive parts do. We may include a short screen recording of an example of a user adding an event, inviting people, and assigning tasks.  <dd> <br>
