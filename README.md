# Host-It

Why use multiple post-its on every surface you have to keep track of things you have to get done for an event you're hosting when you can use our application, Host-It? This app, primarily targeted towards young adults, works to make the process of planning and making an event a much more stress-free, quick process. A registered user can create their own event, invite people to it, and add little post-its for tasks to get done before the event. The application uses the Cordova mobile framework, Onsen for UI edits, and other plugins and APIs.
